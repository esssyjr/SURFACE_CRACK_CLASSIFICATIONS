# SURFACE_CRACK_CLASSIFICATIONS
Welcome to the Surface Crack Classifier project, a sophisticated computer vision model designed to address the critical task of classifying surface images into two distinct categories: surfaces with cracks and those without. This project is born out of the necessity to enhance infrastructure monitoring, material inspection, and various applications where the identification of surface defects is paramount. It is powered by MobileNet transfer learning, excels in precise classification of surface images into cracked and non-cracked categories. Tailored for infrastructure monitoring, quality control, and beyond.
